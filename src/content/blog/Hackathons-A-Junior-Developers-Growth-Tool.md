“A hackathon is an event when programmers and other like minded individuals meet to do collaborative computer programming to solve a problem.” -Wikipedia. Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. Such events are carried for some short period of time like 24-48 hours. You can say that hackathon is a sort of competition where teams of developers, techie, graphic designers, digital enthusiasts, and software engineers gather to build a new product, software, and to solve the problems regarding various issues in a particular field.

Every single participant adds their input to solving the problem in a very effective manner. Hackathons can thus solve almost all problems be it regarding any software solutions or everyday workflow issues or even the formation of new product(s).
