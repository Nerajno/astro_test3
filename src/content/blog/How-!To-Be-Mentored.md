## Intro
Mentorship can be **extremely** challenging to both parties if not done well. It can be defined as a relationship between a more experienced and knowledgeable person, the mentor, and a less experienced person, the mentor mentee, in which the mentor provides guidance, support, and advice to help the mentee develop personally and professionally.A mentor is an experienced individual who willingly shares their knowledge, skills, and expertise with a less experienced person (the mentee) to help them grow and achieve their goals. A mentor should acts as a advisor, role model, and source of inspiration for the mentee.A mentee, on the other hand, is an individual who seeks guidance, support, and knowledge to enhance their skills, knowledge, and personal growth. The mentee actively participates in the mentoring relationship and is responsible for their own development.

## Five Things A Mentee Should Consider Doing: üßê


### Set Clear Goals
Define specific goals and objectives you want to achieve through the mentorship. This will help both you and your mentor focus on areas that require improvement and create a roadmap for your development.

### Be Open and Receptive
Approach the mentorship relationship with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Be receptive to feedback, advice, and constructive criticism provided by your mentor. Embrace new perspectives and be open to exploring different ways of thinking.

###  Take Initiative
Actively seek opportunities to learn and grow. Don't wait for your mentor to provide you with all the guidance. Take ownership of your own development and take the initiative to ask questions, request feedback, and pursue relevant experiences.

### Communicate Effectively
Establish open and honest communication with your mentor. Clearly articulate your needs, concerns, and expectations. Regularly update your mentor on your progress, challenges, and achievements. Actively seek feedback and be receptive to suggestions for improvement.

### Follow Through
Take the advice and guidance provided by your mentor seriously and implement it in your life or work. Show commitment and dedication to your goals and strive to make progress. Regularly review your progress with your mentor and adjust your actions if necessary.

## Three Things A Mentor Should Consider Doing: üßê

### Provide Guidance and Support
 Offer guidance, wisdom, and expertise to the mentee based on their own experiences. Help the mentee navigate challenges, make informed decisions, and overcome obstacles. Be available to provide support and encouragement when needed.

### Share Knowledge and Experience
 Share your knowledge, skills, and experiences with the mentee. Offer insights, lessons learned, and practical advice related to their goals and areas of interest. Provide resources, tools, and connections that can help the mentee in their development.

### Foster Growth and Independence
Encourage the mentee's personal and professional growth by challenging them to step out of their comfort zone and explore new opportunities. Help them identify their strengths and areas for improvement. Empower the mentee to take ownership of their development and make decisions for themselves.

### Summary
Mentorship is a relationship where a more experienced person (mentor) guides and supports a less experienced person (mentee) to help them grow personally and professionally. The mentee should set clear goals, be open to learning, take initiative, communicate effectively, and follow through on advice. The mentor should provide guidance, share knowledge and experience, and foster the mentee's growth and independence.

### Who Am I ( Currently )

Nerando is a software developer with full-stack training, team building, and a dynamic approach to creating realistic web, mobile, and executive hot takes. He has been a part of teams that have conquered broken code, patched legacy codebases, and stopped releasing on Fridays for the overall mental health of his team. When he is not saving the world from bad algorithms, implementations, and a lack of good documentation, you can find him coding and drinking his third cup of coffee.
     Nerando is currently **_seeking new opportunities_** that align and grow with his skillset and experiences, especially with programming languages in React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, DevOps skills, MERN and so much more. He can be found via his [portfolio](https://developindvlpr.com/),
