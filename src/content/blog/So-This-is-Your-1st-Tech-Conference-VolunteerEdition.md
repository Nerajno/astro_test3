With one of my current favorite tech conferences coming up, [RenderATL 2023)](https://www.renderatl.com/), and having a couple conversations and queries from members of the freeCodecamp Atl community.  I have decided to write a series on how to get the most out of being a part of a tech conference as a first timer in several capacities. We are gonna look into being a first-time volunteer.

Attending a tech conference as a volunteer is a rewarding experience, providing an opportunity to connect with other professionals in the industry, gain new skills, and contribute to the success of the event. However, it's essential to keep in mind several considerations to ensure you're making the most of your time and contributing effectively to the conference. From understanding your role and responsibilities to being proactive and flexible, here are ten key takeaways to consider when attending your first tech conference as a volunteer.

### Understanding Responsibilities and Role.
It's crucial to understand your role and responsibilities as a volunteer. So here is how you pull this off, ask questions. Once you found out that you have been selected to be a volunteer, your new job is to familiarize yourself with the conference schedule, your duties schedule, and any guidelines or expectations set by the organizers.  Knowing what is expected of you will ensure that you can fulfill your responsibilities effectively. So attend the volunteer meeting and make notes ( times of talks, names of speakers, who is in charge of emergencies, how to reach AV tech
 , etc). So now all you have to do and be on top of it.

### Appropriate Attire
Dressing appropriately is essential as a volunteer at a tech conference. Let me get this out: this is a tech conference, and your go-to dress code is comfort ... casual or semi-casual is what we are aiming for. As a part of the questions you ask, this should be one of them.  Dress codes or guidelines are important, most are mentioned or provided by the conference organizers to maintain a professional and approachable appearance. My takeaway is to be comfortable while adhering to the guidelines.

### Be Prompt
Punctuality is key when volunteering at a tech conference. Arrive (on time), correction, make that 15 - 20 minutes before your shifts and be prepared to work for the full duration of your shift. This allows you time to troubleshoot any extra issues that may arise, i.e. the speakers are late or missing, equipment issues, etc. So be early for your scheduled time and have an open mind just in case you need to troubleshoot stuff for your assigned sessions or station.

### Go All In
Be proactive in your volunteer duties and look for opportunities to help beyond your assigned tasks. Remember the quote _“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. - Maya Angelou”_. Creating a lingering impression with conference participants, organizers, and speakers can go a long way. These people tend to be the persons going to bat for you when are seeking opportunities. The key takeaway is that you should be proactive and be willing to go the extra mile will demonstrate your commitment to the conference and make a positive impression on attendees, trust me it will come full circle, so just do it.

### Be Warm and Welcoming
Being friendly and approachable is important when volunteering at a tech conference, yes I am speaking to you
and you know what looks like .... so just do it. Here is something you need to understand: you'll be the first point of contact for many attendees, so it's important to personable and be willing to engage with people. You may have to be the person who has to give directions, advice, or figure stuff out with attendees.

### Remember the Rules
It's important to follow instructions provided by the conference organizers and any supervising staff. Remember that you are a guest and as long as the rules don't infringe on your values or morals. Remember, the questions we were to ask before, you ask about the rules in that session or at that time. Now note that these rules may include guidelines around attendee behavior, security protocols, code of conduct, or other procedures. All of that being said, remember to follow the rules and understand their importance.

### Keep Charged
Keep your energy up and stay hydrated. Yes, you have heard it over and over again ... yes you have heard it at school, on a hike, or on a day out in the park. Staying hydrated and fed is essential during a long day of volunteering. Thus bring snacks and water with you as you power through your shift. Also note that grabbing meals is highly advised, especially lunch as you may have time to slow down, gather yourselves and take a breather. So as it needs repeating, stay hydrated and fuelled A.K.A drink your water and have something to eat.

### Network
_"Links run de worl. - Jamaica Proverb"_ or _"Networking is marketing. Marketing yourself, your uniqueness, what you stand for." -- Christine Comaford-Lynch_
Connecting with attendees is a great opportunity to make valuable connections and learn from other professionals in your field and also them to learn from you. Always remember that you carry value to your network. So if it's to connect on LinkedIn, Twitter or exchange other contact information, take time to build or enlarge your network. Please remember also that we need to follow up as it helps to concretize the expanded network.

### Be Flexible
_"Stuff happens"_ or _"Be like water"_. Saying all of this is to say that being flexible and adaptable is important when volunteering at a tech conference. The organizers may need to adjust schedules, reassign volunteers, or handle emergencies, so it's essential to remain flexible and willing to adapt. This also speaks to the tech ecosystem as factors may demand re-adjustments in a variety of ways, thus this is just practice and a part of the craft's toolkit.

### Have Fun
Finally, enjoy yourself, yes, seriously .... have fun. The experience of volunteering at a tech conference if done properly tends to lend itself to loads of fun, shenanigans, and good laughs. As a tech conference volunteer, you tend to have time to connect with event organizers, speakers, guests, and in some cases, sponsors. You will have the chance to meet new people, learn new things, understand tech culture, and be a part of a dynamic and exciting event.
