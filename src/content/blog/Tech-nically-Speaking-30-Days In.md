So the offer letter has been signed and the job search is finally over (mine took 365 days ~ update coming). So the question to be answered is what or what does one do next? The answer ... a lot of unlearning and re-learning. So let's cover a few tips that were instrumental in helping me to become the best version of myself for this new chapter of my tech career. To make it easier, we will break these tips down into the following: onboarding (people and tech), resting( its importance), relearning how to work and deliberate learning.

## Onboarding ~ People and Procedures

Depending on the company's size, orientation or in tech speak, onboarding looks different. I took time to research my team and company and I came up with questions and queries, I got them answered as it helped me to be of better help on the team. Get the company handbook, team/department procedures and learn who are your go-to persons/subject matter experts(SMEs), get all the paperwork that comes with the position.  Take time to read everything given to you, in detail asking for revisions if needed and permitted ( please note that this should also be the case during salary negotiation). I should point out to those of us who contribute to open-source, have a side-hustle or a side project, that you need to get it in writing so that you can continue being you. Take time to get the expectations, goals and other necessities documented (in writing ) and jointly agreed upon. So again the takeaways are to ask questions, make notes and get it all in writing.

## Onboarding ~ Tech and TechStack

From the company, you should have a list of all the equipment that you should receive from your employer. If you need more stuff ( cables, connectors, chargers or stationery ), ask for it citing why you need it. Remember a closed mouth is never fed and we self-advocate here. We would all hope that we work from home but we don't, so get the setup completed and test everything in both locations. The same thing can be said for software installations, get/create the list and double-check with your immediate supervisor if needed and get yourself up to speed. Double-check all the configuration settings and ensure that it works efficiently. If all of the above is done properly,  one should have a production-level environment in a day to a week( this is for large corporations).

The fun should now begin with you being introduced to the
 codebase. This can be done by getting a technical walkthrough, reading the documentation, and speaking with someone about how the software solves the problems of the customers. Always remember that the software you create solves a problem for a customer, this should help you understand the mindset of the user to better create really good solutions to their problems. Again, make all the notes and ask all the questions to help you better understand how to be an effective contributor to the team you are now a part of. I could also gone deeper into vscode setup and app considerations but to each his own and there are tonnes of other articles on this.

## Resting or Rather Its Importance

One can't focus if one is hungry (unless you are on a fast ... that takes some discipline), likewise one can't be the best problem-solving version of themself without sufficient rest. I could go deeper into why this is necessary but
 [reading this](https://dev.to/damcosset/want-to-be-a-better-developer-take-care-of-your-sleep-1def)  and [watch this](https://youtu.be/5MuIMqhT8DM?si=tlXhQe-nUf9yFGiN) will do a better job than I can. Being back to a standard set of hours to get tasks done takes practice and some amount of strategy. My strategy was to completely plug out and sleep till I was thoroughly rested, I also took time to deliberately reset my circadian. All of that ensured that I was able to operate effectively during business hours. I also took time to learn to how meditate as it helped me to learn how to slow my brain down thus enabling me to deepen my focus.
So the takeaways are to learn how to rest, reset your circadian rhythm and learn how to meditate if necessary. Here are [some more food for thought.](https://www.ted.com/search?q=sleep)

## Relearn How To Work Full-Time and Accountability

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/vWBiyFOLqtckVJrmFL/giphy.gif)

If it took you over 30 days to get a new job, there may be some amount of "re-learning how to work" that needs to be done. The job hunt tends to change one's schedule as it has various components ( resume customisation/creation, job applications, networking, interviewing, algorithmic practice, upskilling and project-based learning) and differs from working on a team or being an individual contributor. So it now is time for some re-adjustment, it is said that we are a product of our systems rather than our plans, so let's create new systems. I would suggest the following if you have some issues in the new role you have gotten :

-  a good 30/60/90 plan ( keeps you and your manager on the same page with reasonable achievements in the first 90 days of being a new team member).
- Planning your day ( [this article](https://dev.to/code_jedi/20-easy-ways-to-be-more-productive-as-a-developer-5f99) has broken it into simple actionable steps and somewhat turned the art of productivity into a science.)
- Pomodoro Method (timeboxing[ your work ](https://dev.to/thegeoffstevens/the-pomodoro-technique-and-other-methods-to-get-more-done-with-tools-to-help-p96) in such a way that it helps you to get more done and get you into the flow state )
- The implementation of a [brag document](https://dev.to/keracudmore/brag-documents-why-you-should-have-one-3ldn) (this may be oddly named by it can be used to help you see how one has added value as a team member, please remember that it doesn't have to only be code... think of procedures and policy implementations. Be reminded that this comes in handy when it comes time for a review or promotion).
- Informal check-ins ( during your 1-on-1s or at an appropriate time, do an informal temperature check with your supervisor to help you figure out where you are in upskilling or meeting the needs of your shiny new position, adjust accordingly as needed ).

## Upskilling or Continued Learning

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/us7niy4u06nj0xkyo65b.jpeg)

"Relearning, unlearning and upskilling"... in this profession, these are words we live. So in this new role that we have, take time to figure out what to learn to move from competency to mastery in this new position on its respective tech stack. Since we should all be migrating to [TypeScript](https://youtu.be/U6s2pdxebSo?si=paDyMlsmBX9Dhror) and I now work in [Vue](https://youtu.be/OrxmtDw4pVI?si=5vuEX8xFMrx71l6G), plus I like to know why a tool was created, I took time to watch the origin stories of both. Next, it's either the tutorial &or building small projects phase, simply put ... build sh!t that applies the knowledge you are learning. Learning to leave your ego at the door or the mindset of "I should know this" and ask for help or get to the point of "getting comfortable feeling uncomfortable", thus one should know [how to ask for help on a team.](https://youtu.be/YssP_qMAq0A?si=T5rMGoHk6_8bZ2kD). Another thing is to not abandon your side projects, space them out if you need to but do not abandon them. There is something to be said about having a basic version running version of your side project. Another thing is that as you learn, document and make time to teach.

## Wrapping It Up

So, there you have it, your job-hunting to tech career re: initiation guide with a sprinkle of wisdom and a dash of humour! Remember, onboarding is not just about finding where the coffee machine lives; it's about befriending both your team and your tech stack. And hey, rest isn't just for cats; it's your secret weapon against the zombie apocalypse of burnout. Relearning how to adult with a 9-to-5 gig might seem daunting, but fear not, because planning your day is like playing Tetris with tasks. Lastly, in the grand game of tech, continuous learning is your cheat code, and if all else fails, just remember: when in doubt, stack overflow and ChapGPT are friends, documentation also! Cheers to your
 new adventures!

I would appreciate any feedback or your tips. Find me [@nerajno]() if you would like to chat, my DMs are open.
